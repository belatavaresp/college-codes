O erro no código é escrever além do espaço de memória alocado para a string msg, 
que tem apenas 8 bytes, ao copiar a string "Holberton" de 9 bytes. 
Isso pode levar a comportamento indefinido.

Para corrigir isso, é só alocar memória suficiente para armazenar a string "Holberton"
e o caractere nulo no final, que totalizam 10 bytes, e por fim, 
liberar a memória alocada antes de sair do programa.
