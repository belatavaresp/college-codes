O erro no cÃ³digo Ã© escrever alÃ©m do espaÃ§o de memÃ³ria alocado para a string msg, 
que tem apenas 8 bytes, ao copiar a string "Holberton" de 9 bytes. 
Isso pode levar a comportamento indefinido.

Para corrigir isso, Ã© sÃ³ alocar memÃ³ria suficiente para armazenar a string "Holberton"
e o caractere nulo no final, que totalizam 10 bytes, e por fim, 
liberar a memÃ³ria alocada antes de sair do programa.
