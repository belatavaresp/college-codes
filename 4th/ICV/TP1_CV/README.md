# Problem Description: Image Compression and Decompression

## Task
Implement an image compression method with or without loss using Python version 3.5 or higher. The program should take an input image, perform its encoding, save the encoded file to disk, decode the saved file, display the reconstructed image, and present the resulting PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and compression ratio. Using pre-built functions for image encoding and decoding is not allowed, except for functions for reading, writing, displaying images, and performing image transformations.
